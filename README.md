# github-adapter

I'm bored on long train trips, so I've decided to create some app to learn something and kill time. This app has following functionalities (-for not implemented, + for implemented):
  - menu with user selection,
  - list of chosen user's repos,
  - pull to refresh feature,
  - unit tests.
